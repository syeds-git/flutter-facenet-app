# Flutter facenet app

This app automatically finds images of people such as politicians (could be anyone!) using on device facial recognition using the FaceNet ML model and Flutter framework.

# Notes

Feel free to use the code for following purposes:

1. Learning Flutter
2. Learning to use Tensorflow models with Flutter
3. Enhancing the app to add more features or to improve existing code. I'd love to hear what you make out of it. This can serve as a great starter for school projects. Make sure to checkout the Issues tab for ideas.
